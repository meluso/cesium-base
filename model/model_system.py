Description:

This file contains a model a complex engineered system development process. It
creates the system network, the agents assigned to each node in the network,
and the process of designing the system.

The file takes in a certain amount of nodes to create a system along with an
objective function to find the amount of design cycles that is required for the
system to converge.

Parameters:

    n = [2,3,...,100,...,1000,...,inf)
        An integer value greater than or equal to 2 which specifies the number
        of agents in the system. The default value is 1000.
    obj = (string)
        A string input which specifies the objective function for all agents
        in the system to use to evaluate the quality of a design. The input
        must be one of the following terms, specified with quotes:
            "sphere"          - uses the sphere function as the objective,
                                which is also the default setting
            "ackley"          - uses the Ackley function as the objective
            "rosenbrock"      - uses the Rosenbrock function as the objective
            "styblinski-tang" - uses the Styblinski-Tang function as objective
    edg = [1,2,...,n]
        The number of random edges created for each new node added to the
        network during system generation.
    tri = [0,1]
        Probability of adding a triangle after adding a random edge.
    con = (0,inf)
        The threshold for system convergence. The simulation terminates when
        the system objective evaluation is less than this value away from the
        previous three objective evaluations and the number of evaluations is
        greater than three.
    cyc = (1,inf)
        The maximum number of design cycles the system will undergo before
        stopping.
    tmp = (0.01, 50000]
        A number which determines the initial temp of the dual annealing
        algorithm. The domain options are set by the algorithm.
    itr = [1,2,...,inf)
        The number of iterations that the dual annealing algorithm will run per
        execution. The default value is 1 to increase the difficulty of
        converging, but the value may be increased by integer values.
	mthd = {"","future"}
		Estimate method used by agents. If the value is set to anything other
		than "future" (e.g. ""), the agent will use only current values of
		their designs. If the method is "future", it allows for agents to use
		either current estimates or future predictions with a probability
		specified by parameter p.
	p = [0,1]
		The probability of a node using a specified estimate method. If the
	    method is "", then all agents use current estimates only. If the method
		is "future", then the probability p is used.
    crt = (0,3]
        The cooling rate of the algorithm, which sets how quickly the
        probability distribution of sampling further-off points contracts.
        The domain options are set by the algorithm.

Change Log:
Date:       Author:    Description:
2018-10-10  jmeluso    Initial version.
2019-05-02  jmeluso    Corrected misallocation of probability for communication
                       type to network triangle formation. Now triangles are
                       set to form with a 50% probability statically.
2019-06-19  jmeluso    Removed historical estimate code.
2019-07-09  jmeluso    Added div and itr parameters inhereted from model_agent,
                       plus edg, tri, and con parameters for Monte Carlo
                       testing. Corrected termination evaluation to never
                       complete within the first 3 design cycles to allow for
                       design evolution by removing the else statement. Now,
                       objective evaluations are compared against the previous
                       three objective evaluations and must be within the
                       convergence threshold for all three before terminating.
2019-10-30  jmeluso    Updated to reflect change from basin-hopping to dual
                       annealing in model_agent.
2019-11-04  jmeluso    Differentiated between simulated annealing cooling rate
                       (visit parameter) and initial temperature.
2020-09-24  jmeluso    Reinstituted multiple estimate types with associated
                       parameters from original miscommunication model as
					   method of type "future".
2020-10-06  jmeluso    Added if statement to run from gutter or by direct call.
