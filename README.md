# CESIUM Base

The base instance of the modeling framework called CESIUM: the ComplEx System Integrated Utilities Model. CESIUM simulates the process through which an organization develops a complex engineered system. You'll find a complete description of this modeling framework in the original paper:

J. Meluso, J. Austin-Breneman, J. P. Bagrow, and L. Hébert-Dufresne, “A Review & Framework for Modeling Complex Engineered System Development Processes,” arXiv:2103.12820 [nlin], Mar. 2021, Accessed: Mar. 25, 2021. [Online]. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12820.

Go ahead, fork me! You can cite the model with the description above or by using the included bibtex file. You'll find the code for that original work at the sister respository https://github.com/meluso/cesium-framework.

To run one agent, call test_agent.py. To run the model once, run test_system.py. Happy
